This shows that for a fixed test mark of 50, schools with lower quality get less semester marks, while school's with higher quality get better semester marks. This trend is exponential.

Similarly, school with higher Swedish points get higher semester marks, while schools with lower Swedish points get lower semester marks.

This suggests, the higher the school quality, the better the semester marks.

This shows a very exponential trend. For a school with a Swedish score of 30, the lower the test marks the lower the semester marks. However if a student gets 15% or so for a test mark, he is likely to get get 50% for his semester mark. This suggests that students (from a school with a swedish score of 30) are better at semester work than they are at writing tests.

with a similar trend, a school with a low school quality is likely to get worse semester marks, however after the school has a quality of 2, we see the semester marks get to 50% or so. It would seem first semester generally goes well for students no matter what the school quality.

A student would need at least 9% to be able to pass both semesters
