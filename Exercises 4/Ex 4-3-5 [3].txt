As shown in the script, as different new input patterns are sent through the net, we see a an increase in their errors.

This shows that as new patterns are added, their activations get further and further away from their targets.

In this particular example, using the function f(v)=2*sin(3*v)+1 (where v is in [0:pi/4:2*pi] as the only target trains 
the net on very simple data. Any other input pattern that is not in [0:pi/4:2*pi]  will have activations
further away from the target due to this.
