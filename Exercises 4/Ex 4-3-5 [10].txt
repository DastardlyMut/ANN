I used matlab's timing function (tic toc) to get these times. 

Backpropdemo3a:
	Time = 0.017197 seconds

Backpropdemo3b:
	Time = 0.002616 seconds

Backpropdemo2a
	Time = 0.010018 seconds

Backpropdemo2b
	Time = 0.012369 seconds

Backpropdemo1a
	Time = 0.016732 seconds

Backpropdemo1b
	Time = 0.017072 seconds

As seen from the timings, the 3 layer neural net is the fastest with 0.002616 seconds. 
This tells us that the transfer functions tansig, tansig and purelin are the most efficient when training.

Both the one layer neural networks do not train correctly. We'd possibly need a better way to scale the data
to get the correct activations.
