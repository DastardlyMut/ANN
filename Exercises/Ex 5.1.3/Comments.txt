This was relatively simple to implement.

I used a supervisor script to test different layer sizes for the 2 neuron net.
(var saved in crab_sup.mat)

From here, I deduced that 25 neurons in the 1st layer and 5 neurons in the 2nd would give the best result.

I trained the network, saved the net's weights and biases.
I tested the r^2 values and correlation coeffecient values and they were all high.
I also used a confusion matrix to indicate the number of true positive and negatives

I wrote a function that acceepts new input and classifies a crab.
